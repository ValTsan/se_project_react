# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Features

- Location: Location weather-specific recommendations
- Add clothing: Tailor your wardrobe for clothing recommendations based on weather forecast
- Weather forecast display: View the current weather forecast for informed decision-making

## Technologies used

- React: Developed the front-end interface
- JavaScript: Implementated core application logic and interactions
- HTML/CSS: Structured content and styling visual
- Weather API: Integrated real-time weather data for accurate recommendations
- Git: Managed project versions
